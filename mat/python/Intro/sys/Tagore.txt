Tagore's poems New Moon Gathers describes a harmonious world and praises love with its light lines.

	By plucking her petals you do not gather the beauty of the flower.
	摘下花瓣，并不能得到花的美丽。
	I have heard the liquid murmur of the river through the darkness of midnight
	我听见那河水淙淙的流声，在黑漆的午夜里传过来
	I shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your eyelids I shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly I shall flit out into the darkness.
	我要变成一个梦儿，从你的眼皮的微缝中，钻到你睡眠的深处。当你醒来吃惊地四望时，我便如闪耀的萤火似地熠熠地向暗中飞去了。
